    "In an **`Active FTP`** session, two channels are opened. With this FTP connection, two channels are opened:\n",
    "* The client and server establish a control channel through **TCP port 21.** The client sends commands to the server and the server returns status codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both communication participants can establish the data channel via **TCP port 20.** This channel is used exclusively for data transmission, and the protocol watches for errors during this process. If a connection is broken off during transmission, the transport can be resumed after re-established contact. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a firewall protects the client, the server cannot reply because all external connections are blocked. Because of this, **`Passive FTP Mode`** was developed. With this FTP connection, the server announces a port through which the client can establish the data channel; since the client initiates the connection in this method, the firewall does not block the transfer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The FTP knows different commands and status codes; not all of these commands are consistently implemented on the server. For example, the client-side instructs the server-side to upload or download files, organize directories or delete files. The server responds in each case with a status code that indicates whether the command was successfully implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, when accessing FTP on a server, credentials are needed. It is important to note that FTP is a clear-text protocol that can sometimes be sniffed if conditions on the network are right; however, some servers offer **anonymous FTP,** where the server operator allows any user to upload or download files via FTP without using a password. Since there are security risks associated with this type of public FTP server, the options for users are usually limited.\n",

While FTP uses TCP, TFTP uses **UDP port 69,** making it an unreliable protocol and causing it to use UDP-assited application layer recovery. \n",
    "* TFTP does not support protected login via passwords and sets limits on access based solely on the read and write permissions of a file in the OS\n",
    "   * This leads to TFTP operating exclusively in directories and with files that have been shared with all users and can be read and written globally\n",
    "8 Because of the lack of security, TFTP should only be used in local and protected networks\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "While SNMP was created to monitor network device, it also transmits control commands using agents over **`UDP port 161`.** The client can set specific values in the device and change options and settings with these commands. It is always the client who actively requests information from the server; SNMP also enables the use of **`\"traps\" over UDP port 162`,** which are data packets sent from the SNMP server to the client without being explicitly requested. If a device is configured accordingly, an SNMP trap is sent to the client once a specific event occurs on the server-side. For the SNMP client and server to exchange the respective values, the available SNMP objects must have unique addresses known on both sides; this addressing mechanism for successfully transmitting data and network monitoring using SNMP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into footprinting, the following concepts must be understood:\n",
    "* **`MIB`:** To ensure that SNMP access works across manufacturers and with different client-server combinations, the **Management Information Base (MIB)** was created. MIB is an independent format for storing device information.\n",
    "  * A MIB is a text file in which all querybale SNMP objects of a device are listed in a standardized tree hierarchy. It contains at least one **Object Identifier (OID),** which, in addition to the necessary unique address and a name, also provides information about the type, access rights, and a description of the respective object\n",
    "\n",
    "  * MIB files are written in the **Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)** based ASCII text format. The MIBs do not contain data, but they explain where to find which information and what it looks like, which returns values for the specific OID, or which data type is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`OID`:** An OID represents a node in a hierarchical namespace. A sequence of numbers uniquely identifies each node, allowing the node's position in the tree to be determined. The longer the chain, the more specific the information. Many nodes in the OID tree contain nothing except references to those below them\n",
    "  * The OIDs consist of integers and are usually concatenated by dot notation. A user can look up many MIBs for the associated OIDs in the **Object Identifier Registry.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Community Strings`:** Community strings can be seen as passwords that are used to determine whether the requested information can be viewed or not. \n",

    "The following are potentially encounterable SNMP versions that can be found on machines:\n",
    "* **`SNMPv1`:** Used for network management and monitoring. Of course, this is the first version of the protocol and is still in use in many small networks. It supports the retrieval of information from network devices, allows for the configuration of devices, and provides traps, which are notifications of events. However, SNMPv1 has no built-in authentication mechanism, meaning anyone accessing the network can read and modify the network data. Besides this, SNMPv1 does not support encryption, so the data can be easily intercepted. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **`SNMPv2`:** There are many versions of SNMPv2, but the primary version in use today is **`v2c`,** where the extenction **c** means community-based SNMP. Regarding security, SNMPv2 is on par with SNMPv1 and has been extended with additional functions from the party-based SNMP no longer in use. However, a significant problem with the initial execution of the SNMP protocol is that the community string that provides security is only transmitted in plain text, meaning it has no built-in encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`SNMPv3`:** In SNMPv3, the security has been increased significantly. This includes authentication and transmission encryption (via PSK) of the data. However, the complexity also increases to the same extent, with significantly more configuration options than v2c. \n",

Since these community strings can be bound to any source, identifying the existing community strings can take some time. Before footprinting with snmpwalk, it is critical to scan the machine with nmap. \n",

For example, **PHP has `basename()`,** which will read the path and only return the filename portion. If only a filename is given, then it will return just the filename. If just the path is given, it will treat whatever is after the final `/` as the filename.

In PHP, this can be done by adding **`open_basedir = /var/www` in the php.ini file.** Furthermore, a web designer should ensure that any potentially dangerous modules are disabled, like **`PHP Expect mod_userdir.`**\n",

The DOMPurify JS library can be used for this, which escapes any special characters with a backslash `\\`. which should help ensure that a user does not send any input with special characters, preventing DOM XSS vulnerabilities.

    "**Creating a UFW Allow Rule:** Allow rules allow specific IP addresses or network ranges to send traffic. This should only be done if the machine/network is trusted. Once rules are added to UFW, they can be checked by using the aforementioned `status` command. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Adding Service Rules:** This is important to add if services are running on the Ubuntu machine. If just allowing certain services without additional information, then UFW will automatically allow connections to the service from anywhere. Also, this will automatically create a rule for IPv6, which can open up the attack surface if IPv6 is not used within the network. \n",

    "```bash\n",
    "sudo ufw status numbered\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo ufw delete <number>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a UFW Deny Rule:** If an allow rule permits traffic from a specific IP address but the deny rule blocks traffic from that network, the order in which the rules are input will begin to matter. Because of this, it is important to create the allow rules first \n",

    "sudo ufw deny from x.x.x.x    #specific IP address\n",

For example, if a network was included in a deny rule, a user within that network may still be able to ping the machine with the UFW. In this case, the configuration files containing the default rules can be edited within the **`/etc/ufw`** directory. The **`before.rules`** contains rules that will process before the user-created rules. Accordingly, the **`after.rules`** file contains rules that process after the user-created rules.\n",

    "* Within this file, it is also important to note the difference between INPUT and FORWARD rules. **INPUT** refers to traffic coming into the host computer, and **FORWARD** refers to traffic going onto another computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "After making changes to the **before.rules** file, the firewall must be reloaded\n",
